# Temperature Converter

Let's build an interactive web application to help users convert a temperature in Fahrenheit to Celsius!

## Instructions

1. Create and connect an `index.js` file to `index.html`.
2. Write a function named `convertToCelsius` which takes a temperature in Fahrenheit and returns the equivalent temperature in Celsius.
3. Write a function named `describeTemperature` which takes a temperature in Fahrenheit and returns a description according to this table:

   | Temperature (Â°C) | Description |
   | ---------------- | ----------- |
   | < 0              | very cold   |
   | < 20             | cold        |
   | < 30             | warm        |
   | < 40             | hot         |
   | >= 40            | very hot    |

4. Prompt the user to provide a temperature in Fahrenheit. Then, alert them with a message that tells them the equivalent temperature in Celsius alongside a description of what that temperature would feel like.
